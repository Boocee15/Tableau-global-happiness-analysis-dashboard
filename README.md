This dashboard analyzes the key drivers of national happiness based on the 2024 World Happiness Report. The map and charts are interactive; click on a country to filter all visuals.

 Key Insights:

1.  Geography is a Key Factor:
    The map shows that happiness is not random. The highest-scoring countries are concentrated in Scandinavia and Western Europe, while the lowest-scoring countries are primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

2.  Money is a Major Driver:
    The "GDP vs. Happiness" chart shows a strong, positive correlation. As a country's GDP per capita increases, its happiness score also clearly tends to increase. This suggests economic prosperity is a fundamental building block for a happy society.

3.  Health is Critical:
    The "Life Expectancy vs. Happiness" chart shows an even stronger positive relationship. This confirms that a healthy, long-living population is a critical component of national well-being.
